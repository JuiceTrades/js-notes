~~What is logic? (as it pertains to programming)
- logic is the control flow of your program
- think of logic ass a river that branches off in a few different ways
-it allows you to make the computer do the thinking for you!

~~ the IF statement
The IF statement allows you to run code only if a certain test evaluates as TRUE 

EX:

if(5>10){
  console.log("You'll never see this in the console because 5 is not greater than 10");
}

if(5<10){
  console.log("But you'll definitely see this");
}

~~The ELSE statement
The ELSE statement runs only if the statement in the IF statement is FALSE

EX:

if(5>10){
  console.log("You'll never see this because 5 is not greater than 10");
} else{
  console.log("You will see this though, since 5 < 10 evaluates to false");
}

~~the ELSE IF statement
If you want to run another test before getting to ELSE, you'll want to use ELSE IF

EX:

if(5>10){
  console.log("You'll never see this because 5 is not greater than 10");
}else if(5===5){
  console.log("Yes, 5 really is equal to 5, so this will show up in the console")
}else{
  console.log("We won't get here because our else if evaluates to true");
}


~~FUNCTIONS
-a function is a way to encapsulate code for later use
-it can take arguments which are used as variables inside the function 
(Think of it like this:
var me = "Domitrius Clark" == function me("Domitrius Clark")
-it usually returns a value, which can be used later on or displayed immediately

EX:

// Declare a function called someName that takes
// two arguments: numberOne and otherNumber
function someName(numberOne, otherNumber){
  // return the sum of numberOne, 10, and otherNumber
  return numberOne + 10 + otherNumber;
}
// call your new function, giving it 2 argument values
// numberOne = 4, otherNumber = 14
// log the result to the console
console.log(someName(4, 14));
// Calling a function is also known as "invoking" it

~~LOOPS
-A loop is a block of code that gets repeated for a defined amount of iterations (for loop) or until a certain condition is met (while)
-Typically one variable or condition in the loop changes each time it is run.

LOOPS - FOR
EX:

for(var i = 0; i<10; i++){
  console.log(i)
}

>>0
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9

beers = ["Lagunitas", "Peak"]
for(var i = 0; i< beers.length; i++){
  console.log(beers[i])
}

>>"Lagunitas"
"Peak"
