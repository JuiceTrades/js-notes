~~A VARIABLE is simply a container for a value. 	
EX: 
- var name = "Zach";
- var numberOfWidgets = 10;
- var isCodingCool = true;
 
 ~~An ARRAY is used to hold a collection of data, of any data type. They can hold multiple data types.
 EX:
 ["Snoopy", "Charlie Brown", "Patty", "Violet"]
 [11, 15, 25, 48, 69, "elephant"]
 
 ARRAYS can also be stored INSIDE of variables.
 EX:
 var class_names = ["Julie", "Sophie", "Rob", "John"]

 Once you've declared an array, you can retieve the items inside of it using their indices. The first item always has an index of 0. 
 EX: ["charlie brown", "snoopy"]
 "charlie brown" has an index of 0, while "snoopy" has an index of 1

 An Array can store other Arrays in Multi-dimensional Arrays.
 EX:  var cars = [["Porsche", "Camero"], ["Camry" "Prius"]]

 To access the first array inside then the first item in the array you would use ; 

 console.log(cars[0][0])
 -->"Porsche

 To access the the second array then the first item in that array you would use ;
 console.log(cars[1][0])

 the first [] calls the array the second [] calls the item inside the array

 ~~Another Data type: OBJECTS
 OBJECTS are kinda like arrays, but you the define the keys.
EX:
var car = {make: "Toyota", model: "Prius"}

console.log(car['make'])
-->"Toyota"

OBJECTS: dot notation 
You can use 'dot notation' to get data out of an object 
EX:
var user = {firstName: "Lucille", lastName: "Bluth"}
console.log(user.firstName)
-->"Lucille"
