~~What is an ALGORITHM?
-A set of simple instructions to complete a task IE A function
-Computers aren't smart, they no intuition: an algorithm tells them everything step by step in a language they can understand.
 Examples of algorithmic problem solving:

 // Problem: Display an array's contents along
// with the index number of each array item.

// First, we'll need an array with some items in it

// Next, we'll need to iterate (loop) over the array

// Within our loop, we'll log each array item to the console
// within this log statement, we'll concatenate (add) together
// the array item along with the index number we're currently on

-->Adding code to the algorithm

// First, we'll need an array with some items in it
var my_arr = ["giraffe", "zebra", "antelope"];
// Next, we'll need to iterate (loop) over the array
for(i = 0; i < my_arr.length; i++){


// Within our loop, we'll log each array item to the console
// within this log statement, we'll concatenate (add) together
// the array item with the index number we're currently on
  console.log(i + " " + my_arr[i]);
}

~~The keyword DEBUGGER!
-the keyword, 'debugger' allows for breaks in your scripts
-the function will stop your code, with the option of continuing on in the developer tools

EX:
console.log("hello world")
debugger;
alert('I think I found the bug!')
// the alert will not fire while debugger is on (developer tools)2
